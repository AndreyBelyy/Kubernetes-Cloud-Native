Once you are signed up and logged into your own Google Cloud project, create a GKE cluster following these instructions. 
An Autopilot cluster will be fine for this example, and choose a region that is close to your location. 
You’ll also need to enable the Cloud Build and Artifact Registry APIs in your new project, as we’ll be using those services along with GKE.
Next we’ll walk you through the following steps to prepare for creating the pipeline:

1. Fork the demo repository into your own personal GitHub account.
2. Create a container repository in Artifact Registry.
3. Authenticate Cloud Build to use Artifact Registry and GKE.
4. Create a Cloud Build trigger for building and testing on a push to any Git branch. 
5. Create a trigger for deploying to GKE based on Git tags.
